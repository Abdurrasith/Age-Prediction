# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. The name Machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel

# Regression

In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables.

 Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables.

# Computer Vision

Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions.

# Overview
This Project is an applicaton based on Computer vision and Machne learning implementation using regression supervised classification.

# Installation

Suggested to use Python3 pip version i.e pip3 to install packages.

if you do not have pip3 installed in your system .

Use this command:

     sudo apt-get install python3-pip --upgrade # for pip3
     sudo apt-get install python-pip --upgrade #for pip 
eg:-

     pip3 install scikit-learn #for sklearn
